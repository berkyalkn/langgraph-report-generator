<h3>Legacy and Impact on the NBA</h3>

<p>Stephen Curry's career has been marked by numerous records and accolades, including being the first person to be named MVP by unanimous vote in NBA history. His ability to shoot from beyond the arc has revolutionized the way teams approach the game, with many teams now incorporating more three-point shots into their offense.

<h2>Impact on the NBA</h2>

<h3>Influence on Three-Point Shooting</h3>

<p>The NBA has witnessed a significant increase in three-point shooting since Stephen Curry's rise to prominence. Curry's unprecedented ability to make shots from beyond the arc has encouraged teams to adopt a more perimeter-oriented offense. As a result, the league has seen a substantial surge in three-point attempts, with teams now relying more heavily on outside shooting to create scoring opportunities. Curry's remarkable shooting range and accuracy have raised the bar for shooters across the league, and his influence can be seen in the way teams now construct their rosters and design their offenses.</p>

<h3>Evolution of the Point Guard Position</h3>

<p>Curry's playing style has also contributed to the evolution of the point guard position. Traditionally, point guards were expected to be pass-first players who focused on setting up their teammates for scoring opportunities. However, Curry's success as a scoring point guard has led to a shift in this paradigm. Many teams now look for point guards who can score from both inside and outside the arc, while still maintaining the ability to distribute the ball effectively. This change has led to the development of more versatile point guards who can play both on and off the ball, creating matchup problems for opposing teams.</p>

<h3>Statistical Evidence of Curry's Impact</h3>

<p>The numbers bear out Curry's influence on the NBA. He has made at least one 3-pointer in 967 of his 1,010 career games, a staggering 95.7% rate that ranks first all-time among players who have played at least 1,000 games. Curry's ability to make shots from anywhere on the court has also led to a number of record-breaking performances, including the most three-pointers in an All-Star quarter, half, and game. These achievements have cemented Curry's status as one of the greatest shooters in NBA history and have inspired a new generation of players to focus on developing their outside shooting skills.</p>

<h3>Coaching and Team Strategy</h3>

<p>The hiring of Steve Kerr as the Golden State Warriors' head coach in 2014 marked a turning point in Curry's career, as Kerr's offense emphasized outside shooting and ball movement. This approach allowed Curry to flourish, and his success has led to a proliferation of similar offenses across the league. Many teams now employ coaches who have experience with small-ball lineups and outside shooting, and the use of advanced analytics has become more widespread in an effort to optimize team performance. As a result, the NBA has become a more fast-paced, perimeter-oriented league, with an increased emphasis on shooting and scoring.</p>
